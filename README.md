# Tic-Tac-Toe README

### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, javascript, Boostrap, AJAX

### Development Process
Created a wireframe with general layout of the webpage with a focus on minimal appearance/simple function to keep myself grounded in "not focusing on making it pretty".

Began the HTML file with the skeleton of a gameboard using divs with class labels to help with targeting it for event listeners later.
Started making curl scripts for authentication. Began updating HTML with form inputs for sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, change password, and a button for placeholder button for games.

Began branching to focus features and have better version control going forward.
Feature2: curl scripts for the game

Feature3: created gameboard with click event listeners for the gameboard container. Will reset all boxes upon signing out.

Feature4: added in win conditions, new game button, and display games button. buttons and game board are hidden until successful sign in.
-hit roadblock; rewrote on paper what the click expectations were


### Problem-Solving
Git Version Control
  -I had started using my master for my starter code not realizing that is what a branch is for. After many branch merges and attempts at rebasing, I just copied over the correct code into the master branch to override all of the issues that were coming from having bad branching.

Game Logic
  -Talked with consultants and cohort members through a lot of frustration and confusion over the syntax/logic. Wrote out pseudocode in notebooks and talking outloud to myself to think through the process. I also started leaving comments on code and trying to make a mental map of where each piece of code was and how they were entangled with each other.

Styling Issues
  -Game winner text was being applied to the previous styling then immediately overwritten by another message. 
### Unsolved Problems
Make use of the various other form functions regarding showing a game, showing all games played, and possibly returning to an unfinished game. The forms are in the html, and many of hte pieces are set up but there just isn't enough time at the moment for me to implement them.
Better styling.
